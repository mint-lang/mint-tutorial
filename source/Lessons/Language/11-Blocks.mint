        In some of the previous chapters, there were `let` statements (which we
        cover later on). These statements appear in **blocks**.

        A **block** is just a number of statements enclosed by brackets `{...}`
        used in many places (function body, branches of `if` expressions, etc...),
        but they can be used as a **standalone expression** as well:

        ```mint
        {
          let name = "Joe"

          ...
        }
        ```

        Statements in a block are evaluated sequentially from top to bottom and
        the value from the last statement is returned.

    }
}
