        A **component** is a collection of UI elements which together serve a
        specific function. You can think of buttons, checkboxes, selects, images,
        etc... as components.

        All components **must have** a **render function**. This functions tells
        the browser what to display. It can return a single HTML tag, a string
        or an array of them.

        There is a special component called `Main`, which is the root element
        and it's displayed on the screen. All other components will be added
        to this component.
